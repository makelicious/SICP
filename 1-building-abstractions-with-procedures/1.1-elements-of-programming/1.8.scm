; Exercise 1.8:
; Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation
; to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value
; (x/y2+2y) /3.
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure
; analogous to the square-root procedure.

(define (cube-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (cube-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess))
        (* 2 guess))
      3))

(define (square x)
(* x x))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
 (< (abs (- (cube guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (cube x)
  (* x x x))

(define (cube-root x)
  (cube-iter 1.0 x))
